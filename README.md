This project is accomplished by following Javascript udemy course but for learning purposes, I have used different API than the one which Jonas has used. 

This is my first time ever working on such a complex project. Hope you all liked it.

Technology stack used:
- JavaScript (ES6/7/8)
- node.js

Dev tools
- webpack

- fractional
- uniqid

I would like to thank you Mr. Jonas Schmiddmann for providing such an amazing course.
